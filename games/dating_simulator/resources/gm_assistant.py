NPC’S RESPONSE: ["Level"]["Main Action"]["Sub Action"]["NPC"]["Reaction"] # neutral: I have no strong opinion on that. But why not?
NPC’S DIALOGUE: ["Level"]["Main Action"]["Sub Action"]["NPC"]["Dialogue"] # "Hmm, I've never really been into yoga, but I'm game if you are. Let's give it a shot! Just don't expect me to be too flexible, I'm more of a 'jump into action' kind of person."
