Based on the chosen main actions of the player character (PC) and the response of the NPC to PC, 
you are supposed to create 4 possible sub actions the PC can do. Include a dialogue phrase consisting of one sentence.

Example: 
MAIN ACTION: Feed the ducks. 
NPC RESPONSE: Very cool! 

NUMBER) SUB ACTION:”DIALOGUE”
1) Buy duck food: “Let’s buy some food for the ducks!”.
2) Start a conversation: “Let’s talk a little and get to know each other more!”
3) Run after ducks: “Wanna chase these ducks??”
4) Get intimate with your date: “I know a great spot to spend some alone time”
