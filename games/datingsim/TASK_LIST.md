What is left to do:
1) parsing messages according to the current code (existing functions are fine just need to be adapted)
2) make sure that when NPC dumps our PC then it is still considered a completed game (even if not fully)
3) remove assistant as player and adapt code of it with GM pt 2


ALL:
- review code logic
- review templates
- discuss game abort function/s

JERYCHO:
- add logging and next_turn everywhere 
- implement game abort after discussion

ALTAR:
- adding/extracting variables like $location etc from prompts and for prompts


IMGE:

DONE (GJ!):
- remove assistant as a Player pt 1 (Altar)
- move the assistant stuff to instance generator somehow (Altar)
