	 You are about to play a game with another player. In this game, you and the other player are both on an dating app, looking for a partner. In this case, both you and the other player decided, that you fancy each other's profile. Your and the other player's GOAL is it, to come to an agreement on what to do on your first date. At the start of the game you will be given two character sheets. The first one is the one, that defines your personality. The second one includes the information you know of the other player based on the information in their Bio on the dating app. You will start the conversation.\\ \tt On each further turn you can react to what the other player tells you. For this you can either continue the conversation if you have not met an agreement yet or are not happy with the proposal, or end the game by agreeing to the proposal. \\ \tt \\ \tt There is a total of four agreements throughout the game: "Agreement on Time", "Agreement on Location", "Agreement on Action", "Overall Agreement". You and the other player need to find an agreement on each of them.\\ \tt You should only choose "Overall Agreement" after you and your date manage to settle an agreement for the other three ones (Time, Location, Action). \\ \tt You have 15 turns to finish the game and find all agreements. \\ \tt \\ \tt Your answer has to consist ONLY of the following information and follow the given template:\\ \tt \\ \tt [reason] Your reason for your decision.

This can include your sentiment, opinion, alternative. [end]\\ \tt \\ \tt Your answer for [response] must NOT exceed 100 tokens.\\ \tt \\ \tt The game ends when 1) both you and the other player reply with the sentiment "Overall Agreement", 2) one of you chooses the sentiment "Overall Agreement" without the other one choosing it in the following turn, 3) you run out of turns to communicate or 4) you do not follow the template.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is your character: {'NAME': 'Casey Rivers', 'GENDER': 'Non-binary', 'AGE': 25, 'APPEARANCE': 'Long auburn hair, hazel eyes, casual chic attire, freckles, soft-spokenr.', 'OCCUPATION': 'Bookstore Owner', 'LIKES': 'Poetry, herbal tea, rainy days.', 'DISLIKES': 'Loud environments, fast fashion, injustice.', 'HOBBIES': 'Writing, gardening, knitting.', 'SUMMARY': 'Some might say I have grandma hobbies, others however appreciate the quality and time I invest to handmade them clothes.'}\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the character of the other player: ${'NAME': 'Riley Jones', 'SUMMARY': 'Creating jewlry is a passion of mine!
