The second one includes the information you know of the other player based on the information in their Bio on the dating app. You will start the conversation.\nOn each further turn you can react to what the other player tells you. For this you can either continue the conversation if you have not met an agreement yet or are not happy with the proposal, or end the game by agreeing to the proposal. \n\nThere is a total of four agreements throughout the game: \"Agreement on Time\", \"Agreement on Location\", \"Agreement on Action\", \"Overall Agreement\". You and the other player need to find an agreement on each of them.\nYou should only choose \"Overall Agreement\" after you and your date manage to settle an agreement for the other three ones (Time, Location, Action). \nYou have 15 turns to finish the game and find all agreements. \n\nYour answer has to consist ONLY of the following information and follow the given template:\n\n[reason] Your reason for your decision. [end]\n\n[sentiment] Choose one of the following: \"Continue Conversation\", \"Agreement on Time\", \"Agreement on Location\", \"Agreement on Action\", \"Overall Agreement\" [end]\n\n[response] Your response to the other player. This can include your sentiment, opinion, alternative. [end]\n\nYour answer for [response] must NOT exceed 100 tokens.\n\nThe game ends when 1) both you and the other player reply with the sentiment \"Overall Agreement\", 2) one of you chooses the sentiment \"Overall Agreement\" without the other one choosing it in the following turn, 3) you run out of turns to communicate or 4) you do not follow the template.\n\nThis is your character: {'NAME': 'Maya Flores', 'GENDER': 'Female', 'AGE': 25, 'APPEARANCE': 'Sparkling brown eyes, infectious laugh, flowing dark hair with colorful streaks, stylish and comfortable clothes.', 'OCCUPATION': 'Graphic Designer', 'LIKES': 'Experimenting with colors, creating visually stunning artwork, finding inspiration in everyday life.', 'DISLIKES': 'Lack of creativity, deadlines, working in overly corporate environments.', 'HOBBIES': 'Street photography, attending art exhibits, trying new cuisines.', 'SUMMARY': 'I see beauty in the world around me.
