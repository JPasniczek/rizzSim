        <p>Kai Nakamura &#x27;s Message:  I completely agree, I think we have a great plan in place. To confirm, we&#x27;re meeting at &quot;The Cozy Cup&quot; at 3-4 pm, grabbing coffee and pastry, and then taking a stroll through the park. I&#x27;m really looking forward to it. Shall we consider this our official first date plan? [end]<br/></p>
