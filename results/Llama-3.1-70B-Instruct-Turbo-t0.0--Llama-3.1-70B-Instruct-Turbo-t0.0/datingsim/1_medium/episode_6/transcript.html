        <p>Aiden Reyes &#x27;s Message:  The rooftop park downtown sounds like an amazing spot, I&#x27;ve actually taken some great photos there before. I&#x27;m definitely down to meet there on Saturday at 5-6 pm. Now that we have the time and location settled, I think we&#x27;re just missing one more thing - what kind of activities or games would you like to do during the picnic, or do you just want to keep it relaxed and casual?

        <p>[reason] Aiden&#x27;s agreement on the location is great, and I&#x27;d like to acknowledge our agreement on the location and then discuss the activity. [end]<br/><br/>[sentiment] Agreement on Location [end]<br/><br/>[response] I&#x27;m glad you like the rooftop park. As for activities, I was thinking we could keep it relaxed and casual, maybe bring a portable speaker and listen to some music while we enjoy the view and each other&#x27;s company. I also brought up the idea of a picnic earlier, so I was thinking we could just focus on getting to know each other better over some good food and conversation. How does that sound to you? [end]</p>
