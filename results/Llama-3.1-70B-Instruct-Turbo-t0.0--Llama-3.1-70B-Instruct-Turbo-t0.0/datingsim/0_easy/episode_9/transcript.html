        <p>Riley Jones &#x27;s Message:  2 or 3 pm works for me, let&#x27;s say 2:30 pm to be exact. I was thinking of creating a pendant with a nature-inspired design, maybe a leaf or a flower. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different metal textures and patterns, and I&#x27;d love to incorporate some of your tattoo art style into the design. What do you think about adding some intricate line work or patterns to the pendant? [end]<br/></p>
