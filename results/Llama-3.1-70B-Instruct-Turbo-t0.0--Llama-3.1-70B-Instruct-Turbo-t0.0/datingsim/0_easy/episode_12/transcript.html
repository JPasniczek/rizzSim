        <p>Noah Sullivan &#x27;s Message:  I like your approach, Aiden. I was thinking we could just take it easy and explore the garden together, see what catches our eye, and maybe even bring our cameras to capture some moments. If we feel like it, we could also grab a coffee or snack at the café and chat some more. Sound like a plan to you? [end]<br/></p>
