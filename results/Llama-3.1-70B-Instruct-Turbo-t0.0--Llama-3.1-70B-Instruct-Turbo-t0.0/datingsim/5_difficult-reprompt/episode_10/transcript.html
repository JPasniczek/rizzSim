        <p>Sakura Nakamura &#x27;s Message:  I understand your enthusiasm for photography, Mia, but I&#x27;m not sure if it would be suitable during the ceremony itself. Perhaps we could have a mini photo shoot afterwards, as you suggested, but keep the ceremony itself focused on the traditional rituals and mindfulness? [end]<br/></p>
