I can appreciate the process of layering dough, it's similar to the layering of ink in tattooing. I love creating custom, meaningful pieces that tell a person's story.

As for getting a tattoo, I've actually thought about it, but I've never had the chance to sit down and think about what I'd want. I've always been more of a 'draw it out' kind of person, I love sketching in my free time. Maybe one day I'll have to come by your shop and we can brainstorm some ideas.
