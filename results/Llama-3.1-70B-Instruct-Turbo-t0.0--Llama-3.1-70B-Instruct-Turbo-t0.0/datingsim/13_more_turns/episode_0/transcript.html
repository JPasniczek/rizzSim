        <p>Dr. Olivia Khan &#x27;s Message:  I think the escape room sounds like a great idea, I&#x27;ve heard good things about the one downtown. Let&#x27;s plan to do that in the afternoon. Now that we have a plan for the morning and afternoon, I think we&#x27;re getting close to finalizing our date. [end]<br/></p>
