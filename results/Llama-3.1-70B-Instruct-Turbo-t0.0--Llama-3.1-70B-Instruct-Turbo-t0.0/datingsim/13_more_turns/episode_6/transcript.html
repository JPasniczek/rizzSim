        <p>Taylor Jordan &#x27;s Message:  I was thinking we could just enjoy the concert and the atmosphere, maybe take a walk around the park afterwards if the weather&#x27;s nice. But if you&#x27;re up for it, we could also check out some of the local art vendors that usually set up shop near the concert venue. What do you think? [end]<br/></p>
