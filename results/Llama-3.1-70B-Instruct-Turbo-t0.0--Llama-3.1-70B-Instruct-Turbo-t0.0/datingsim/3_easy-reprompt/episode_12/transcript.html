        <p>Noah Sullivan &#x27;s Message:  That&#x27;s correct, 4-5 pm on the Oak Ridge Trail sounds like a great plan. However, I think we&#x27;ve only settled on the time and location so far. I&#x27;m excited about the hike, but I was thinking, would you like to grab a coffee or dinner afterwards to unwind and get to know each other better? [end]<br/></p>
