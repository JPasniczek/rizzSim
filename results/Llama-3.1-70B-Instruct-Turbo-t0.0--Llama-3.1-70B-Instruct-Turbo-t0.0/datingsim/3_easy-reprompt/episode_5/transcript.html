        <p>Samira Hassan &#x27;s Message:  I&#x27;m thrilled that you&#x27;re excited about the plan, Hiro. It sounds like we have a great evening ahead of us. To recap, we&#x27;ve agreed on an 8-10 pm stargazing date at the secluded spot on the outskirts of town, with snacks, drinks, and some fun facts about the constellations. Shall we consider this our final plan and make it official? [end]<br/></p>
