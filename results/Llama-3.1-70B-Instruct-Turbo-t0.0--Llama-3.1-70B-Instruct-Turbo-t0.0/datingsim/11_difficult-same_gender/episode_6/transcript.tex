	 Mia Patel 's Message:  I think meeting at a café near the mountain range or coastal route would be a great idea. That way, we can both arrive separately and get to know each other in a public setting before heading out on the ride. Plus, it would give us a chance to grab that coffee and snack I mentioned earlier. How about we choose a café and meet there at, say, 1 pm? [end]\\ \tt
