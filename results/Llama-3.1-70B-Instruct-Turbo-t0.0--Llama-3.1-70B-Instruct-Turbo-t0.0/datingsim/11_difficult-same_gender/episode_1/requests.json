You and the other player need to find an agreement on each of them.\nYou should only choose \"Overall Agreement\" after you and your date manage to settle an agreement for the other three ones (Time, Location, Action). \nYou have 15 turns to finish the game and find all agreements. \n\nYour answer has to consist ONLY of the following information and follow the given template:\n\n[reason] Your reason for your decision.
