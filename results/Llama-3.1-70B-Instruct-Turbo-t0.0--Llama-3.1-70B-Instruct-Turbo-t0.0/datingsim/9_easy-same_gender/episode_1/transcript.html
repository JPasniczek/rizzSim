        <p>Marcus Bennett &#x27;s Message:  That sounds like a perfect spot, Aiden. I know the arts district, and I&#x27;m familiar with the coffee shop you&#x27;re referring to. Meeting there at 2 pm works great for me. Now that we have our time, activity, and location settled, I think we&#x27;re all set for a great first date. Shall we consider this our plan, or is there anything else you&#x27;d like to add or change? [end]<br/></p>

        <p>[reason] The other player confirmed the location and seems to be satisfied with the plan, and I am too, so I can now agree on the overall plan. [end]<br/><br/>[sentiment] Agreement on Action, Overall Agreement [end]<br/><br/>[response] I think we&#x27;ve got a great plan in place, Marcus. I&#x27;m really looking forward to our street art adventure and getting to know you better. I&#x27;m good with everything as is, so let&#x27;s consider this our plan. See you at 2 pm at the coffee shop! [end]</p>
