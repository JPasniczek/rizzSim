	 Hiro Suzuki 's Message:  I'm glad you like the idea. As for location, I was thinking somewhere in the city center would be convenient for both of us. There's a great fine dining restaurant near the city square that I've been wanting to try. As for time, I'm usually busy with streaming during the week, so how about we plan for Saturday evening? Would that work for you? [end]\\ \tt

	 [reason] Hiro's suggestion for the location and time seems reasonable, and I think I can agree on both, but I want to confirm the specifics. [end]\\ \tt \\ \tt [sentiment] Agreement on Time, Agreement on Location [end]\\ \tt \\ \tt [response] Saturday evening sounds perfect for me, and the city center is a great location. The fine dining restaurant near the city square sounds like a great choice, I'd love to try it out. Shall we plan for, say, 7 pm on Saturday? And would you like to meet at the restaurant or would you prefer I pick you up? [end]
