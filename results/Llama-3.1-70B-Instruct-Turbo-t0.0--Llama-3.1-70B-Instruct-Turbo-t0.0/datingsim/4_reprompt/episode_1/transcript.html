        <p>Mia Patel &#x27;s Message:  I think that sounds beautiful, Robin. A late afternoon picnic at the arboretum will be perfect. The soft light will be great for photos, and it&#x27;s a lovely way to unwind after a day of work. Now that we have the location and time, I think we just need to finalize the action - are you leaning more towards a picnic or a hike, or do you want to do a bit of both? [end]<br/></p>

We could start with a leisurely hike to explore the arboretum and enjoy the scenery, and then settle down for a picnic in a beautiful spot. That way, we can enjoy the best of both worlds and make the most of our time together. Does that sound like a plan to you? [end]</p>
