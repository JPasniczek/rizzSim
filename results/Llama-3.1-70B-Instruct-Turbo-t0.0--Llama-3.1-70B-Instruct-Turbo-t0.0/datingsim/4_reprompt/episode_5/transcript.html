        <p>Kai Nakamura &#x27;s Message:  I like the sound of a stroll through the park, Ethan. However, I was thinking it might be nice to combine it with something a bit more active. There&#x27;s a rock climbing spot nearby that I&#x27;ve been wanting to try out. Would you be up for giving it a go with me after our tea? [end]<br/></p>

I&#x27;m more of a leisurely stroll kind of person. How about we compromise and take a walk through the park, and then visit the university&#x27;s botanical garden instead? I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s lovely this time of year. [end]</p>
